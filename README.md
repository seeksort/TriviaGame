# TriviaGame

(jQuery, JS, HTML/CSS) A geography trivia game, featuring photos of our lovely planet.

I utilized one timer each for the question and answer pages. I also ran into an issue where my click handler kept running the same function after one click, and I consequently learned about the concepts of event propagation and bubbling.

I wanted to reattempt making a page with pure HTML and CSS. The layout of the page is inspired by [Outlook 365's web sign-in page](https://outlook.office365.com/), which I thought was a decent starting point for showcasing nice images.
